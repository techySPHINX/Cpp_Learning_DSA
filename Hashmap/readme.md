# Hashing in Problem Solving

## Why We Do Hashing

Hashing is a technique used to uniquely identify a specific object from a group of similar objects. It is widely used in various applications due to its efficiency in searching, inserting, and deleting operations.

## Uses of Hashing

1. **Fast Data Retrieval**: Hashing allows for constant time complexity, O(1), for search operations in the average case.
2. **Efficient Data Storage**: It helps in efficiently storing and retrieving data using hash tables.
3. **Data Integrity**: Hash functions are used in various algorithms to ensure data integrity.
4. **Cryptography**: Hashing is fundamental in cryptographic algorithms to secure data.
5. **Load Balancing**: Hashing helps in distributing data evenly across multiple servers.
6. **Caching**: It is used in caching mechanisms to quickly access frequently used data.

Hashing is a powerful tool in computer science that optimizes performance and ensures data security and integrity.
